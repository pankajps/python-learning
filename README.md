# 🐍 Python Learning Exercises – Day-to-Day Progress

Welcome to my Python learning journey!
This repository is a collection of daily Python exercises, concepts, and mini-projects as I explore and deepen my understanding of Python programming.

## 📅 Daily Goals

- 🔁 Practice Python daily (even a small amount counts)
- ✅ Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking
- 🧠 Learn by doing – not just reading
- 🗂️ Build a useful reference for myself and others
