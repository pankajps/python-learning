**Q1: Write a Python program to demonstrate a single-line comment.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program that includes a single-line comment using the # symbol.

**Background:**
Comments are used to explain code and are ignored during execution. A single-line comment starts with a #.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Write single-line comments
* Document code for clarity
* Improve code readability

Sample Program:

```
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Q2: Write a Python program using multi-line comments.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program that demonstrates how to use multi-line comments to describe a block of code.

**Background:**
Multi-line comments can be written using triple quotes (''' or """) and are often used for longer descriptions.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Use multi-line comments
* Document code sections effectively
* Improve script readability

Sample Program:

```
"""
This program demonstrates the use of multi-line comments.
It prints a simple message to the user.
"""
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
```

**Q3: Write a Python program that calculates the sum of two numbers in a single line.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program to add two numbers using a single-line expression.

**Background:**
Python supports writing simple logic in one line for brevity and clarity.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Declare variables
* Perform arithmetic
* Write compact code

Sample Program:

```
print("Sum is:", 5 + 10)
```

**Q4: Write a Python program that checks whether a number is positive or negative.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program that takes a number and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

**Background:**
Using conditionals like if-else, you can evaluate number properties and execute logic accordingly.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Use conditional statements
* Compare values with zero
* Display appropriate messages

Sample Program:

```
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num < 0:
    print("Negative number")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

**Q5: Write a Python program to perform a mathematical operation and display the result in a single line.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program that performs a calculation like multiplication and displays the result in one line.

**Background:**
Python allows combining expressions and function calls in a single line for simplicity.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Combine expressions with print
* Perform and display calculations concisely
* Use arithmetic operators inline

Sample Program:

```
print("Result of 8 * 7 is:", 8 * 7)
```

**Q6: Write a Python program that asks for the user's name and prints it using a multi-line statement.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program using multi-line syntax (line continuation) to take user input and print a message.

**Background:**
Python allows multi-line statements using backslashes \ or by enclosing code in parentheses.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Use input() for user interaction
* Split long statements for readability
* Print formatted output

Sample Program:

```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " \
      + name + "! Welcome to Python.")
```

**Q7: Write a Python program that prints a multi-line string.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program to print a string that spans multiple lines.

**Background:**
Multi-line strings are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and preserve formatting including newlines.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Use multi-line strings
* Preserve formatting across lines
* Output descriptive or formatted text

Sample Program:

```
print("""This is a multi-line string.
It spans multiple lines.
Python is fun!""")
```

**Q8: Write a Python program to use input() function to take two inputs from the user and print them.**

**Objective:**
Write a Python program to take two user inputs using input() and display both values.

**Background:**
input() allows dynamic user interaction and accepts string input from the user during program execution.

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
* Use input() to collect data
* Handle multiple inputs
* Print user-provided values

Sample Program:

```
first = input("Enter first value: ")
second = input("Enter second value: ")
print("You entered:", first, "and", second)
```
